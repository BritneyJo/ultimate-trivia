The Project

This project was an accumulation of four weeks of intense training on HTML, CSS, JS, & JQuery. The goal of the project was to build a working trivia game utilizing what was learned. 

This is a working project for now. The goal is to have an event handler tied to the carousel buttons that will open a survey with different difficulty levels based on the button clicked. 

More to be added at a future date.
